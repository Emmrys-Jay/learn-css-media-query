### A project which i used to practice writing CSS media queries.


<p>I completed this project while following the tutorial by <a href="https://github.com/JoyShaheb">Joy Shabeb</a> on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHG7IJuST_BXJkne-0u0Xtw">YouTube channel</a> </p>

<h3>Some of my takeaways from the tutorial:</h3>

<ul>
<li> Understood the power of SCSS (pronounced Sass) and its advantages over vanilla CSS.
<li> Understood how to write media queries to make websites more responsive.
<li> Understood how to use shortcuts to spin up div tags with specific attributes easily on Visual Studio Code.
<li> Learnt about more CSS properties and units such as 'vh' and 'vw'
<li> Learnt about "coolors.co" where you can instantly generate color palettes
</ul> <br><br>
